# Fluvio Data Platform

```bash
fluvio cluster start --k8 --namespace fluvio --use-k8-port-forwarding
```

Re-establish port forwarding after the install (it's only temporary during install)

In k9s, service `fluvio-sc-public` forward to localhost:30003 and `fluvio-spu-main` forward to localhost:30004 if you want fluvio commands to work by default
